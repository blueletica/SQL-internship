Task 1: SQL Data Analysis
Description:
Perform data analysis using SQL queries on a
provided dataset, focusing on extracting
meaningful insights and patterns.
GUIDELINES
FOR
TASK 1
1. Data Exploration:
- Explore the dataset'
s structure, identify key tables, and understand relationships between them.
- Check for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
2. Basic Queries:
- Write basic SQL queries to retrieve specific data subsets or aggregate information.
- Utilize SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses effectively.
3. Join Operations:
- Practice different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to combine data from multiple tables.
- Understand how join operations affect result sets.
4. Data Transformation:
- Use SQL functions to transform data, such as converting data types, handling NULL values, or
extracting substrings.
- Employ aggregate functions for summarizing data (e.g., SUM, COUNT, AVG).
5. Complex Queries and Analysis:
- Write complex SQL queries involving subqueries, nested queries, or window functions for advanced
analysis.
- Perform trend analysis, identify outliers, or calculate metrics using SQL.
Task 2: SQL Database Design and Optimization
Description:
Design a database schema, optimize queries, and
explore performance tuning techniques using
SQL.
GUIDELINES
FOR
TASK 2
1. Database Design:
- Design a normalized database schema for a given scenario, focusing on table
structures, relationships, and constraints.
- Implement primary keys, foreign keys, and appropriate indexing.
2. Query Optimization:
- Write and optimize SQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval.
- Analyze query execution plans, identify bottlenecks, and refactor queries for
better performance.
3. Indexing and Tuning:
- Implement indexing strategies to improve query performance.
- Explore techniques like clustered and non-clustered indexes, covering indexes,
and index hints.
4. Normalization and Denormalization:
- Understand the concepts of normalization and denormalization and apply
them appropriately in database design.
- Evaluate trade-offs between normalization levels for performance and data
integrity.
5. Performance Monitoring:
- Use SQL profiling tools to monitor database performance.
- Identify and resolve issues related to locking, blocking, or slow queries.
